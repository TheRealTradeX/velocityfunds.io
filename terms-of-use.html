    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Velocity Funds
      website, evaluation programs, simulated trading environments, funded accounts,
      and all related services (“Services”). By accessing or using our Services, you agree
      to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">1. About Velocity Funds</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Velocity Funds is a technology and evaluation company offering simulated trading
      assessments (“Velocity Starter”) and simulated funded accounts (“Velocity Funded”). 
      We do not provide brokerage services, investment advice, or access to live markets.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">2. Simulated Trading Environment</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      All trading conducted during the Velocity Starter evaluation and Velocity Funded
      programs occurs in a simulated environment. Trade executions, fills, slippage,
      and order routing do not reflect live market conditions.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-neutral-400">
      You acknowledge that:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li>Performance in simulated accounts does not guarantee future real-world results.</li>
        <li>Rewards are based on your performance within our rules and parameters.</li>
        <li>Velocity Funds does not execute, clear, or settle live trades.</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Velocity Funds is not a broker, dealer, financial advisor, or fiduciary. No part of
      our Services constitutes investment advice, trading recommendations, or solicitation
      of financial instruments.
    </p>

      or removal from the program without refund.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">5. Rewards & Payouts</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">

      performance and adhere to the Reward Cycle schedule, split structure, and Dynamic
      Reward Cap associated with each account size.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      All rewards are discretionary, subject to manual review, and may be adjusted or denied

      CFTC RULE 4.41 – Hypothetical or simulated performance results have 
      inherent limitations. Unlike actual trading, simulated results do not represent

      similar to those shown.

          Velocity Funds operates an evaluation and simulated trading environment solely for analytical, educational,
          and skill-assessment purposes. Any models, data, or performance metrics presented through the Velocity Funds
          platform do not reflect actual live trading in regulated markets and do not guarantee or imply future

        <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Risk Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Trading and speculation in financial markets-whether real, simulated, or educational-carry a high degree of
          risk. Participation in simulated evaluations or live trading can result in substantial loss, including the
          loss of all invested capital or more. Simulated performance does not guarantee similar outcomes in live
          markets, as conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and execution speed differ significantly.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Participants should engage only with <em>risk capital</em>-funds they can afford to lose without impacting
          financial stability or lifestyle. While no real capital is at risk in simulations, strategies developed in
          simulated environments may not perform effectively in live markets. Velocity Funds LLC does not warrant the
          accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any content and makes no assurance of future success or
          profitability.

        <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Hypothetical Performance Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          All performance results displayed or referenced by Velocity Funds LLC are hypothetical or simulated unless
          explicitly stated otherwise. Hypothetical results have inherent limitations-they are developed with the
          benefit of hindsight and do not reflect actual trading. Simulated results cannot fully capture real-world
          factors such as liquidity constraints, emotional decision-making, or execution delays.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          No representation is made that any account will achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in
          simulations. Testimonials and user stories are anecdotal and not indicative of typical results. Past
          performance, whether simulated or real, is not a reliable indicator of future outcomes.

      <div>
        <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Customer Compensation Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          All trading examples and compensation illustrations presented by Velocity Funds LLC are hypothetical and for
          educational purposes only. They do not involve real capital or represent live trading conditions. Simulated
          accounts differ materially from live trading accounts in terms of execution, slippage, and psychological
          pressures. Velocity Funds makes no warranty that any participant will achieve comparable results.

        <p>
          In accordance with Rule 4.41 of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Hypothetical or
          simulated performance results have inherent limitations. They do not represent actual trading. Since trades
          have not been executed, results may under- or over-compensate for market factors such as liquidity, execution,

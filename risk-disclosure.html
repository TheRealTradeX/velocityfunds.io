<section class="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 py-16 leading-relaxed">
  <h1 class="section-title">Risk Disclosure</h1>
  <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-2">Last updated: <span id="year"></span></p>

  <p class="text-neutral-300 mt-6">
    Trading in futures, derivatives, and other leveraged financial instruments involves
    a high degree of risk and is not suitable for all investors. This Risk Disclosure
    is intended to help you understand the nature of those risks when using
    <strong>Velocity Funds LLC</strong> (“Velocity Funds”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) evaluation
    and simulated funded account programs.
  </p>
  <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-3">
    By participating in any Velocity Funds program (including Velocity Starter evaluations
    and Velocity Funded accounts), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accept
    the risks described below, as well as those outlined in our Terms of Use and related policies.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">1. Market Risk & Volatility</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Futures and derivatives markets can be highly volatile. Price movements may be sudden and
    substantial, and can be driven by a wide range of factors including economic data,
    geopolitical events, central bank policies, liquidity conditions, and market sentiment.
    Even disciplined strategies can experience rapid and significant drawdowns.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">2. Leverage & Magnified Losses</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Trading futures typically involves leverage, which allows you to control a large notional
    position with a smaller amount of capital. While leverage can amplify gains, it also
    magnifies losses. A relatively small move in the underlying market can result in substantial
    losses and may quickly exceed the value of your account in a live environment.
  </p>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mt-2">
    Even though Velocity Funds operates in a simulated environment, your risk parameters
    (such as account size, daily loss limits, and trailing drawdown) are designed to reflect
    the realities of leveraged trading risk and may result in rapid failure of an evaluation
    or termination of a simulated funded account.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">3. Simulated Trading vs. Live Trading</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Velocity Funds programs are based on <strong>simulated trading</strong>. Orders, fills,
    and price feeds in our environment are not live executions on regulated exchanges.
    As a result:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1 mt-2">
    <li>Simulated fills may differ from real-world fills in terms of slippage, latency, and liquidity.</li>
    <li>Simulated performance may not accurately reflect emotional and psychological pressures experienced in live trading.</li>
    <li>Risk controls may behave differently than those of an actual brokerage account.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-3 italic">
    Past performance in a simulated environment does not guarantee future performance in live markets.
    No representation is made that any account will achieve profits or losses similar to those seen in
    a simulation or example.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">4. No Investment Advice</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    The information provided by Velocity Funds is for educational and evaluation purposes only.
    We do not provide investment, tax, legal, or financial advice, and nothing on our website or
    within our programs should be interpreted as a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.
    You are solely responsible for your trading decisions and strategies.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">5. Use of Risk Capital Only</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Trading, whether live or simulated, should only be undertaken with <em>risk capital</em> — funds
    that you can afford to lose without impacting your financial stability, lifestyle, or obligations.
    Even though Velocity Funds operates in a simulated environment, strategies and habits formed here
    may influence future live trading behavior. You should carefully evaluate your financial situation,
    experience level, and risk tolerance before engaging in any trading activity.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">6. Program Rules & Forced Liquidation</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Each Velocity Funds program is governed by specific rules (including maximum daily loss,
    trailing drawdown, minimum trading days, consistency requirements, and Weekly/Dynamic Reward Caps).
    Violating these rules can result in immediate failure of an evaluation, removal from a program,
    or termination of a simulated funded account.
  </p>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mt-2">
    You are responsible for understanding and monitoring all applicable rules. Our enforcement of
    these rules is part of our risk management framework and is not negotiable.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">7. Technology, Connectivity & Platform Risk</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Trading systems and technology are subject to failures, delays, and interruptions. These may arise
    from issues including, but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1 mt-2">
    <li>Internet connectivity problems or ISP outages.</li>
    <li>Platform or server maintenance, instability, or downtime.</li>
    <li>Delays or disruptions in data feeds or simulated order execution.</li>
    <li>Hardware malfunctions (computers, devices, network equipment).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mt-3">
    Velocity Funds does not guarantee uninterrupted access to its platform and is not liable for losses,
    missed opportunities, or evaluation failures caused by technical issues, whether on our side or yours.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">8. Regulatory & Jurisdictional Considerations</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Trading regulations vary by country and jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to ensure that your
    participation in Velocity Funds programs complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations
    in your location. We do not represent that our Services are appropriate or available for use in every
    jurisdiction.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">9. Hypothetical & Simulated Performance</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Any performance results, leaderboards, account summaries, or payout examples provided by Velocity Funds
    are hypothetical or simulated unless explicitly stated otherwise. Hypothetical performance has inherent
    limitations:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1 mt-2">
    <li>Results are developed with the benefit of hindsight.</li>
    <li>They do not reflect real financial risk or psychological pressure.</li>
    <li>They may not account for real-world execution issues such as slippage, partial fills, or liquidity constraints.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-3 italic">
    No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar
    to those shown in any examples, marketing materials, or simulations.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">10. Rewards, Splits & Dynamic Caps</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Rewards offered through the Velocity Funded program (including profit splits and Weekly/Dynamic Reward Caps)
    are discretionary and subject to your adherence to all rules, risk limits, and compliance reviews. 
    Reward structures, caps, and eligibility criteria may change over time at our sole discretion.
  </p>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mt-2">
    You should not rely on any specific payout, reward cycle, or profit figure as guaranteed or promised income.
    All examples are illustrative only.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    By participating in Velocity Funds programs, you agree that Velocity Funds LLC will not be liable for any
    direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with your
    use of the Services, including but not limited to evaluation failures, loss of data, platform outages,
    or decisions you make in your own trading activities.
  </p>

          <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Risk Disclosure</h2>
          <p>Trading and speculation in financial markets-whether real, simulated, or educational-carry a high degree of risk. Participation in simulated evaluations or live trading can result in substantial loss, including the loss of all invested capital or more. Simulated performance does not guarantee similar outcomes in live markets, as conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and execution speed differ significantly.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">Participants should engage only with <em>risk capital</em>-funds they can afford to lose without impacting financial stability or lifestyle. While no real capital is at risk in simulations, strategies developed in simulated environments may not perform effectively in live markets. Velocity Funds LLC does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any content and makes no assurance of future success or profitability.</p>

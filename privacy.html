  <p class="text-neutral-400 text-sm mt-2">Last updated: <span id="year"></span></p>

  <p class="text-neutral-300 mt-6">
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Velocity Funds LLC</strong> (“Velocity Funds”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)

    If you do not agree, please do not use the website or Services.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">We collect information in three main ways:</p>

  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    We may receive information about you from third-party service providers that help us operate our business
    (for example, payment processors, analytics providers, or trading platform partners). Any such data is handled
    in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our agreements with those providers.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mb-2">We use the information we collect to:</p>

  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">3. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mb-2">
    We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve our website. Cookies are small text files stored
    on your device that help us:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1">
    <li>Keep you signed in and maintain session security.</li>
    <li>Remember your preferences (such as chosen account size or theme).</li>

    Most browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies via settings. However, some features of the site may not
    function properly if cookies are disabled.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">4. Payment Processing</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    We use third-party payment processors to handle subscription and one-time payments.
    Your full card details are processed directly by those providers and are not stored on our own servers.
    We may retain limited billing information (such as the last four digits of your card, expiration date,
    and billing address) for records, fraud prevention, and customer support.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">5. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mb-2">
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following situations:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1">
    <li>
      <span class="font-semibold">Service providers:</span> With trusted vendors who perform services on our behalf
      (e.g., hosting, analytics, payment processing, communications). They are allowed to use information only as
      necessary to provide services to us.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-semibold">Legal and compliance:</span> When required by law, regulation, legal process, or
      to protect our rights, users, or the public.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-semibold">Business transfers:</span> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or
      sale of assets, where user information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations,
    resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and support legitimate business operations. When information is no longer
    needed, we will delete or anonymize it in a commercially reasonable manner.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">7. Security</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access,
    loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot
    guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials confidential and notifying us
    promptly of any suspected unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">8. International Users</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
    Our infrastructure may be located in the United States or other jurisdictions. By using the Services, you consent
    to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in those locations, which may have data-protection laws
    different from your country of residence.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">9. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm mb-2">
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-300 text-sm space-y-1">
    <li>Access or request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>

Nothing herein constitutes investment advice, solicitation, or an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments, securities, or products in any jurisdiction. The information is not directed toward any specific individual or entity and should not be construed as personalized financial, legal, or tax advice.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">Velocity Funds operates an evaluation and simulated trading environment solely for analytical, educational, and skill-assessment purposes. Any models, data, or performance metrics presented through the Velocity Funds platform do not reflect actual live trading in regulated markets and do not guarantee or imply future performance. Each user is responsible for ensuring that access or use of the platform complies with their jurisdiction's laws and regulations.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Risk Disclosure</h2>
          <p>Trading and speculation in financial markets-whether real, simulated, or educational-carry a high degree of risk. Participation in simulated evaluations or live trading can result in substantial loss, including the loss of all invested capital or more. Simulated performance does not guarantee similar outcomes in live markets, as conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and execution speed differ significantly.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">Participants should engage only with <em>risk capital</em>-funds they can afford to lose without impacting financial stability or lifestyle. While no real capital is at risk in simulations, strategies developed in simulated environments may not perform effectively in live markets. Velocity Funds LLC does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any content and makes no assurance of future success or profitability.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Hypothetical Performance Disclosure</h2>
          <p>All performance results displayed or referenced by Velocity Funds LLC are hypothetical or simulated unless explicitly stated otherwise. Hypothetical results have inherent limitations-they are developed with the benefit of hindsight and do not reflect actual trading. Simulated results cannot fully capture real-world factors such as liquidity constraints, emotional decision-making, or execution delays.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">No representation is made that any account will achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in simulations. Testimonials and user stories are anecdotal and not indicative of typical results. Past performance, whether simulated or real, is not a reliable indicator of future outcomes.</p>

          <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Customer Compensation Disclosure</h2>
          <p>All trading examples and compensation illustrations presented by Velocity Funds LLC are hypothetical and for educational purposes only. They do not involve real capital or represent live trading conditions. Simulated accounts differ materially from live trading accounts in terms of execution, slippage, and psychological pressures. Velocity Funds makes no warranty that any participant will achieve comparable results.</p>

          <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">CFTC Rule 4.41 Compliance Statement</h2>
          <p>In accordance with Rule 4.41 of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. They do not represent actual trading. Since trades have not been executed, results may under- or over-compensate for market factors such as liquidity, execution, and psychology.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">No representation is made that any account will achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Testimonials or endorsements are not representative of all users' experiences. Past results, whether simulated or real, are not indicative of future performance.

<!-- Program Rules – Fully Simulated Environment -->
<section id="program-rules" class="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 py-16">
  <h2 class="section-title">Program Rules in a Fully Simulated Environment</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">
    These rules apply to all Velocity Starter evaluations and Velocity Funded simulated accounts operated by
    <strong>Velocity Funds LLC</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="mt-10 space-y-8 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">

    <!-- 1. Discipline & Consistency -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">1. Discipline, Pace & Consistency</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Velocity Funds is built around professional risk behavior, not one-off lucky runs. There is no fixed time limit
        to reach your profit target as long as your subscription is active, but you must respect the minimum trading
        days shown in the rules table above.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>Your results must show <strong>consistent execution</strong>, not extreme single-day spikes.</li>
        <li>During the evaluation, no single day’s net profit may exceed <strong>40% of your total evaluation profits</strong>.</li>
        <li>Accounts may be reviewed or disqualified if trading behavior resembles gambling, martingale,
          or other non-professional patterns.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- 2. Trading Behaviour & Rules -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">2. Trading Behaviour & Rules</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        All trading must be conducted fairly and in line with how a professional futures desk would operate.
        Any attempt to game the environment or exploit technical limitations may result in account closure.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>No intentional latency, arbitrage, or platform-exploit strategies.</li>
        <li>No mirroring, copy trading, or signal-sharing between multiple Velocity accounts for the purpose
          of bypassing rules.</li>
        <li>No fully automated high-frequency systems designed to exploit tick data or infrastructure instead of
          market opportunity.</li>
        <li>All positions must comply with the <strong>contract limits, risk limits, and product restrictions</strong>
          shown on this page and inside your dashboard.</li>
        <li>Holding into restricted events or trading behavior that contradicts broker or exchange rules may result in
          disqualification, even if other metrics are respected.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- 3. Trading Instruments -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">3. Trading Instruments</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Velocity Funds currently operates in a <strong>fully simulated futures environment</strong> using our
        supported brokerage and technology partners (for example, Rithmic). Only products made available in your
        platform and account are permitted.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>You may trade the exchange-traded futures contracts and micros enabled in your login.</li>
        <li>Spot FX, crypto, options, CFDs, and any product not explicitly enabled in your account are not permitted.</li>
        <li>All positions must be closed in accordance with exchange hours and any overnight/holiday restrictions
          communicated by Velocity Funds or its partners.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- 4. Account Credentials -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">4. Account Credentials & Usage</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Every evaluation and funded login is intended for <strong>a single individual trader</strong>. Sharing access
        or operating as an undeclared group harms both the firm and other traders.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>Do not share your dashboard or platform credentials with anyone.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for all trades placed under your credentials, whether placed by you or someone you
          allowed to access your account.</li>
        <li>Velocity Funds may suspend or close accounts that show signs of credential sharing, multi-user activity,
          or other security risks.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 5. Resets & Breaches -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">5. Breaches, Violations & Resets</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Your account is considered breached if you violate any of the core risk parameters or behavioural rules.
        The live rules table above is the source of truth for current limits.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>Breaching the <strong>Max End-of-Day Trailing Loss</strong> or <strong>Maximum Daily Loss</strong>
          displayed for your account will fail the account.</li>
        <li>Exceeding your maximum allowed contracts/micros will result in a breach.</li>
        <li>Serious behavioural violations (for example platform abuse, prohibited arbitrage, or account sharing)
          may result in immediate closure with no eligibility for resets or rewards.</li>
        <li>Reset options, when available, will be shown clearly in your client dashboard and may require a reset fee
          or new evaluation purchase.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- 6. Rewards & Payouts -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">6. Rewards, Dynamic Caps & Payout Structure</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        All Velocity Funded accounts remain <strong>simulated</strong>. Rewards are paid based on performance in the
        simulated environment, subject to review of risk, behavior, and consistency.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>Reward cycles are typically every <strong>5 active trading days</strong> with an
          <strong>80% reward split</strong>, as shown in the rules table.</li>
        <li>Funded accounts are subject to a <strong>dynamic reward cap</strong> per payout cycle.
          The current caps for each account size are reflected in the Dynamic Reward Cap table on this page.</li>
        <li>
          For the <strong>$50K Velocity Starter program</strong>, traders may operate under either:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
            <li>our standard dynamic reward schedule, or</li>
            <li>a flat <strong>$1,000 reward cap per cycle</strong>, selectable inside the dashboard.</li>
          </ul>
          The dashboard clearly displays which mode (Dynamic or $1,000 Cap) is active for your account.
        </li>
        <li>Rewards are only paid on accounts that have respected all rules, including the consistency rule and
          contract limits. Violations discovered during review may void a pending reward.</li>
        <li>Velocity Funds may adjust reward schedules, caps, or splits over time. Any changes will be communicated
          on this page and/or in your dashboard and will only apply going forward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-neutral-400 text-xs mt-2">
        Note: All activity takes place in a simulated environment. No live market funds are deposited to or withdrawn
        from any broker account in your name as a result of participating in Velocity Starter or Velocity Funded
        programs.

    <!-- 7. “Live” / Velocity Funded Stage -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">7. Velocity Funded (“Live”) Stage</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        When you pass the evaluation and move into the Velocity Funded stage, you are still trading a simulated
        account. Velocity Funds may use your performance to inform internal risk allocation, but you have no claim on
        specific firm capital or positions.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>All risk parameters (trailing loss, contract limits, etc.) continue to apply in the funded stage.</li>
        <li>Failure to respect rules in the funded stage can result in account closure and forfeiture of pending rewards.</li>
        <li>Velocity Funds reserves the right to end, pause, or modify a funded account at its discretion in order to
          manage firmwide risk.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 8. Inactivity -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">8. Inactivity & Account Closure</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        To keep the environment efficient, inactive accounts may be closed so resources can be reallocated to
        active traders.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>If no trades are placed for an extended period (for example, 30 consecutive calendar days),
          your evaluation or funded account may be marked inactive and closed.</li>
        <li>Closed inactive accounts are not eligible for rewards. A new evaluation purchase may be required
          to participate again.</li>
        <li>Specific inactivity windows and processes may be updated over time and communicated via email,
          dashboard notifications, or this page.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 9. IP Address & Multiple Accounts -->
    <article class="panel space-y-3">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-white">9. IP Address, Devices & Multiple Accounts</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300">
        Velocity Funds monitors logins and trade flow to protect the integrity of the programs.
        Activity that appears coordinated or abusive may lead to review or closure of related accounts.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-neutral-300">
        <li>Multiple accounts accessing from the same IP address or device may be reviewed for copy trading
          or other prohibited coordination.</li>
        <li>Using VPNs, VPSs, or remote servers is allowed, but attempting to hide identity or circumvent
          restrictions is not.</li>
        <li>Velocity Funds may merge, close, or restrict accounts that appear to be used collectively to bypass
          contract limits, reward caps, or other rules.</li>

        <h2 class="glow-header text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">Risk Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Trading and speculation in financial markets-whether real, simulated, or educational-carry a high degree of risk. Participation in simulated evaluations or live trading can result in substantial loss, including the loss of all invested capital or more. Simulated performance does not guarantee similar outcomes in live markets, as conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and execution speed differ significantly.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Participants should engage only with <em>risk capital</em>-funds they can afford to lose without impacting financial stability or lifestyle. While no real capital is at risk in simulations, strategies developed in simulated environments may not perform effectively in live markets. Velocity Funds LLC does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any content and makes no assurance of future success or profitability.</p>
